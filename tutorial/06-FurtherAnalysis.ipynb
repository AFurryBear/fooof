    "FOOOF is really a way to extract features of interest from your data, features that can then be examined across or between groups of interest, or perhaps fed into further analysis. Largely, it is up to you what to do after running FOOOF. Here, we briefly introduce some analysis utilities that are packaged with FOOOF, and explore some simple analyses that can be done with FOOOF outputs. "
