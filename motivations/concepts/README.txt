Concepts
--------

Conceptually, we consider neural time series, and thus neural power spectra, to contain multiple 'components', specifically, periodic and aperiodic components, that can each vary independently. 

In these examples, we motivate that even though time series *can* be perfectly represented by a sum of sine waves, this does not imply that that power at a particular frequency in a power spectrum necessarily reflects rhythmic activity, and why it is important and interesting to also investigate aperiodic activity.
