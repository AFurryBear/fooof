Using the conceptual framework whereby we consider neural data to comprise by periodic and activity activity, here we examine how this conception relates to many common analysis approaches employed with neural data.

Broadly, these examples compare an existing approach to parameterizing neural power spectra, and seek to surface if and how different methods may have trouble adjudicating between different aspects of the data changing.
